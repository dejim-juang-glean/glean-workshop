        <ol type="1" start="1">
<li>In the Search Bar enter the following (It is formulated into a question on purpose):<br><br><strong>How do I install the Confluence Connector?<br><br></strong>As you can see the SERP responded the same as it did earlier with a series of documents in relevant order.  However, since you entered a question into the Search Bar, it also popped the Glean AI Assistant Card as the top result in order to answer your question in Natural Language as shown:<br><br><img style="width: 537.53px" src="img/e42f4a7a9f848965.png"><br><img style="width: 421.50px" src="img/e80b515a38b81fd1.png"></li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Step 5: Automatically Generated Answers" duration="0">
        <ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Glean automatically generates a Glossary of Terms as well as Answers while it is indexing your company&#39;s corpus of knowledge.  Let&#39;s show an example of this.<br><br>Enter the following into the Search Box:<br><br><strong>What is a go link?<br><br></strong>As you can see an Answer Card responds as the first Search Result as shown:<br><br><img style="width: 526.90px" src="img/275042f0f35560fc.png"><br><br>Glean Customers use Go Links extensively to quickly get access to web applications that are typically difficult to remember or have very long URLs.</li>
<li>Hover over the <img style="width: 22.00px" src="img/72db2a78dc14d645.png">icon in the Answer Card as shown:<br><br><img style="width: 403.00px" src="img/7a12d371762e7e91.png"><br><br>As you can see the Answer was automatically detected in the &#34;How Go Links work | Glean Help Center&#34; document.  Feedback can be shared if the user of the Glean Platform believes this automatically generated Answer is incorrect.  (DO NOT share feedback at this point, the answer in this case is accurate).<br></li>
<li>As mentioned earlier, Glean also automatically generates a Glossary of Terms based upon the indexed content.  This helps the Glean Platform understand how employees speak within your organization.  Since this is a Public Instance of Glean without extensive data from any specific organization, the Glossary has not been detected automatically.<br><br>To show the concept however, consider the following screenshot from Glean&#39;s Internal Production instance:<br><br><img style="width: 502.50px" src="img/77fdfac48453c72.png"><br><br>The user in this case asked what QE meant.  QE could mean many different things depending on the company.  However, within Glean QE means Query Endpoint.  <br></li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Step 6: Find an Expert within your Company" duration="0">
        <p>Oftentimes you would like to find out who is considered an expert in a certain area or topic within your organization.  This type of activity typically involves either asking somebody else who hopefully knows the answer, or by attempting to figure it out by reading a bunch of content on the topic.<br><br>Well... Since Glean IS reading your entire company content and is staying up to date with changes, it knows who the experts are in your company.<br></p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>In the Search Box enter the following:<br><br><strong>Who&#39;s the expert on the Confluence Connector?<br><br></strong>You should see results similar to the following:<br><br>As you can see the user &#34;CEO Sandbox&#34; is the expert on the Atlassian Connector?  If this were a production instance, it would be a real user within your organization.  But, how did the platform figure out that CEO Sandbox is the expert?<br><br>As mentioned above, Glean is reading your entire company knowledge and learning who is creating/modifying content and correlating that information with the context of the content itself.  Glean also knows where the user(s) are within the company&#39;s hierarchy. </li>
</ol>
<p>This is also taken into account when answering questions such as this:<img style="width: 412.50px" src="img/2484c47fcd2c571e.png"></p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 404.50px" src="img/6dd7f448afe46753.png"></p>
<p>If you ever want to understand a bit of &#34;why&#34; Glean has responded in a certain way, or in this case, expert identification. Go ahead and ask Glean in the &#34;Ask a follow-up question&#34; box:</p>
