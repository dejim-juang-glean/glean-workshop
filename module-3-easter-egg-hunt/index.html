        <p>Sometimes it might feel like finding pertinent information within your organization can be like an Easter Egg Hunt where you are looking for your favorite piece of candy and can&#39;t find the right egg.  For those of you who do not know what an Easter Egg Hunt is, either ask your neighbor or ask Glean <strong><em>(Navigate to Glean Assistant, select Public Knowledge and then ask)</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Well as you&#39;ve learned, Glean can remove the Hunt-and-Peck method of searching for your company&#39;s knowledge to bring you right to the answer the first time.</p>
<p>In this Lab, you are going to need to find our hidden Easter Egg in order for you to provide your Workshop Feedback as well as be registered to receive some Glean SWAG. </p>

        <p>This shouldn&#39;t be too hard with all the ingenious indexing and retrieval algorithms in the Glean Platform.  Use what you&#39;ve learned in this workshop to find our Easter Egg. (Hint, start in Assistant)</p>

        <p>In this lab, you have learned how the Glean Generative AI Assistant can create on-the-fly Step-by-Step instructions for a given task or set of tasks.  In this case it outlined how to use the Glean Platform to create a Custom AI Assistant for a sub-domain of knowledge within your enterprise.</p>
<p>This Custom Glean App used a feature of the platform called &#34;Answers&#34; which was discussed earlier in Lab 1.  It also took advantage of an Actions feature which was used to submit your Workshop Feedback.  Your workshop moderator will show you how this Action was built as a final piece of this workshop before we draw the winner.</p>
<p>With all you&#39;ve learned today, you can imagine the realm of possibilities for what the Glean Platform including Glean Apps and Actions can do to help your employees be more productive in their day to day activities.</p>
<p>(Optional) Module 3b: Post-Workshop Activities!</p>
