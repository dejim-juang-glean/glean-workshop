        <p>Glean Agents are a comprehensive platform feature designed for building, orchestrating, and managing AI agents within enterprises, aimed at scaling AI adoption across various business operations. They enable users to create personalized agents using natural language and offer a library of pre-built agents that can be tailored for specific tasks. Glean Agents operate using an agentic reasoning engine that supports complex workflows driven by company data and external information. This platform not only facilitates the construction of agents but also incorporates governance measures to ensure data security and compliance, making it a strategic tool for enhancing productivity and automating processes across departments.</p>
<p>In this lab we will:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Explore an existing agent including learning how to extend it.</li>
<li>Create a Q&amp;A Chatbot Agent</li>
<li>Build an Agent from Scratch</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, the author has control over the formatting of the response including adding additional instructions for the Reasoning engine to assist in the output.  Note the Markdown syntax for the response formatting.  While this is not required, it can be helpful since LLMs deeply understand the Markdown syntax.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s now execute this agent directly from the Design Canvas.  Click the <img style="width: 81.60px" src="img/372cef49bee67aaf.png">button in the upper right corner to expand the test window on the left side of the screen as shown:<br><br><img style="width: 571.60px" src="img/5a1d3c87e036c6e1.png"><br></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Run agent</strong> button to execute.<br><img style="width: 387.50px" src="img/e573a1b64aeceee2.png"></p>
<p><br>Follow the output similar to what you see on the right:<br><br>The above example could be beneficial as an Agent that runs automatically on a scheduled basis in the morning before you start your day.  The message could be fed automatically to Email, or your company&#39;s messaging program (Teams, Slack, etc...)<br><br>Think about how you extend this Agent to drive additional value (Look for only unread Slack/Email messages..).</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Hackathon: Build an Agent" duration="0">
        <p>It&#39;s now your opportunity to build your own agent based upon what you&#39;ve already learned.  Pick one of the two options below.  And if you have time, build both 🙂.  Let&#39;s see what you can come up with.  If you get stuck at any time, or just need a nudge to get started, flag down one of the Glean Staff to get some assistance.<br><br>Notes before you build:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember, this is a Public Sandbox environment and therefore the amount of data indexed and available is fairly limited.  This should not diminish your ability to build out an interesting Agent though.</li>
<li>When you create the Agent, be sure to put your name as part of the Agent name so there are no conflicts with other workshop participants.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Option 1: Pull Request Reviewer Agent</h2>
<p>The purpose of this Agent will be to analyze a Pull Request in GitHub.  It should assist the analyzer in understanding whether the pull request is ready to be merged or whether it should be sent back to the engineering team to resolve.<br><br>As part of the analysis, it should look at the published Style Guides available in this Sandbox instance to check adherence of any changed code against the guides.  You can find these guides by searching for <strong>style guides</strong> in Glean Search (Home menu option).<br><br>Since this is a Public Sandbox instance, we don&#39;t have a ton of Pull Request to test your Agent against.  However, here are a couple pull request links you can test against:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/glean-go-demo/mcp-server/pull/5" target="_blank">https://github.com/glean-go-demo/mcp-server/pull/5</a><br>The above should show a Typescript Change that is non-concerning (just some config changes)...<br></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/glean-go-demo/mcp-server/pull/6" target="_blank">https://github.com/glean-go-demo/mcp-server/pull/6</a><br>The above has some code changes that should be concerning...<br></li>
</ul>
<p>Hint:  In order to read the Diffs of the Pull Requests, you will need to take advantage of one of Glean&#39;s out-of-the-box Actions for GitHub called: GitHub PR Diff Fetcher.  It may also be interesting to branch for each language the style guides are evaluating...</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Option 2: Support Issue Resolver Agent</h2>
<p>The purpose of this Agent is to resolve a customer issue by generating actionable next steps to debug.  The support agent will enter a natural language issue into the Agent to kick it off.  The agent should look for information in Confluence, Jira, Google Drive, and the Glean Docs website.  It should then take the knowledge it found and provide a response to the user on a suggested means of resolving the issue at hand.<br><br>As this is a Sandbox Environment we don&#39;t have access to a vast library of Knowledge Base Articles and closed Support Incidents, however there is some documentation that can provide value for a couple of issues.  Try out the following two inputs to the agent after you&#39;ve completed your agent build:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>sharepoint credential error</strong></li>
<li><strong>servicenow indexing problem</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Hint:  It may be helpful to use the Company search Action with Manual search queries selected. This allows for specified search queries and also allows for multiple individual searches to be executed as part of the single action.  An example of a couple of these manual searches might be:<br><br><img style="width: 443.00px" src="img/da747d4aebb73085.png"></p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Conclusion" duration="0">
        <p>Throughout this lab, we explored the capabilities of Glean Agents as a robust platform for building, orchestrating, and managing AI agents within enterprise environments. Participants engaged hands-on with pre-built agents, extended their functionality, and progressed to creating custom agents from scratch. Key steps included analyzing the Plan My Day Agent&#39;s multi-step workflows, developing a Q&amp;A Chatbot tailored to HR policies, and using branching logic and external data integrations—demonstrating how Glean Agents facilitate personalized automation while maintaining compliance and data security. The structured walkthroughs and practical exercises illuminated the flexibility and utility of Glean&#39;s agentic reasoning engine in automating complex, data-driven tasks across different business functions.</p>
<p>As a final step, the lab encouraged creative application through a hackathon—where users synthesized their learnings to design and implement agents for real-world challenges, such as pull request review automation or support issue resolution. Although the sandbox environment featured limited data, the exercise highlighted Glean Agents&#39; adaptability and potential to drive operational efficiencies and streamline decision processes. Moving forward, leveraging these foundational skills and the Glean platform&#39;s extensibility, users are well-positioned to address a broad range of enterprise automation scenarios, further enhancing productivity and innovation within their organizations.</p>
